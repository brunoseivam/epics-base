<h3>Update antelope and e_flex</h3>

<p>Pull in newer versions of the lexer and parser generator tools
to allow generation of re-entrant parsers.
Also, newer byacc supports bison destructor extension
to simplify cleanup of parser stack.</p>

<p>Update e_flex from 2.3 (circa 1993) to 2.5.29 (circa 2003).
This is the most recent version before flex began depending on M4
at runtime.</p>

<p>Update antelope (aka. byacc) to version 20141006.
Don't really know what version was in use before.</p>

<h3>Callback subsystem API</h3>

<p>Added a new macro <tt>callbackGetPriority(prio, callback)</tt> to the
callback.h header and removed the need for dbScan.c to reach into the internals
of its CALLBACK objects.</p>
